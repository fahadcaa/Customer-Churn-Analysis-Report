Customer Churn Prediction Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer churn prediction, aimed at identifying and understanding customer attrition patterns for a business. The project utilizes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques to uncover insights and predict which customers are likely to churn.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze customer churn data, identify key features contributing to churn, and build a predictive model to help businesses take proactive actions in retaining customers. The dataset used for analysis includes various customer-related features, including demographics, subscription details, and customer behavior metrics.

Key Features:
Data Exploration & Cleaning: The dataset is first explored, cleaned, and preprocessed to ensure quality for analysis and modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Several visualizations and insights were generated to understand the relationships between features and customer churn.
Feature Engineering: Categorical variables were encoded, missing values were handled, and unnecessary features were removed.
Machine Learning: A Random Forest Classifier was used to build a churn prediction model, with performance metrics like accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix being evaluated.
Feature Importance Analysis: Key features that impact customer churn were identified and visualized.
Model Saving: The trained model, scaler, and encoders were saved for future use in predictions.
Tools and Libraries:
Python
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Joblib
Key Steps:
Dataset Loading: The dataset is loaded and explored using Pandas.
Data Preprocessing: Missing values, categorical variables, and numeric features are cleaned and processed.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Various charts and plots were created to understand churn distribution, correlation analysis, and feature relationships.
Model Training: A Random Forest model was trained and evaluated.
Model Saving: The model and relevant pre-processing tools were saved using Joblib for easy reuse.
How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Place your dataset in the appropriate directory.
Run the Jupyter Notebook for full analysis and predictions.
The trained model, scaler, and encoders are saved and can be used for future predictions.
Usage Example:
python
Copy
Edit
# Load the saved model and scaler
import joblib

model = joblib.load('churn_prediction_model.pkl')
scaler = joblib.load('churn_prediction_scaler.pkl')

# Make predictions on new data
predictions = model.predict(scaler.transform(new_data))
Conclusion:
This project serves as an in-depth analysis of customer churn and demonstrates how businesses can use data science to improve customer retention strategies. By predicting churn and understanding its drivers, companies can tailor their services and offerings to retain valuable customers and reduce attrition.
